# Real-Time Flight Delay Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting real-time flight delays using machine learning techniques. It integrates real-time data sources such as weather conditions, air traffic, and airport operations to provide accurate flight delay forecasts. This system aims to improve operational efficiency for airlines, enhance the passenger experience, and optimize overall flight management.

- Enhanced accuracy through advanced ML techniques (e.g., deep learning)
- Incorporation of diverse real-time data sources like:
  - Live weather updates
  - Air traffic patterns
  - Satellite imagery
  - Aircraft telemetry
- Smarter crew scheduling, gate assignments, and baggage handling
- Reduction of overall delay impacts

---

## Conclusion
This system offers real-time flight delay predictions, assisting passengers and airlines with informed decision-making. It enhances passenger satisfaction, improves operational efficiency, and helps airlines reduce costs associated with delays.
